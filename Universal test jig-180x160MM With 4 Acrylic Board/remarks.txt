add universal test rig_fdm printing parts drawing
test jig is from https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001779451202.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2nld
it is 180X160mm pcb universal test jig with 4layer acrylic panels.
example pcba under test: 10mmX24mm with usb C pcb, pogo pins are 075 types,  test points are 2mm pitch.

all parts are designed with FDM printer.
I printed the parts in Prusa i3 with 0.15mm setting

For 2mm pitch pogo pins I use 075 type pogo. Due to the printer, the holes for the pogo to go through to contact the pcb may need to drill a little bigger. I used driller 1.5mm.
